# Changelog

## 2026-05-24
- Created the NightApproach tutorial platformer scene using placeholder square blocks.
- Added StartArea, SmallStep, GapJump, three StairPlatforms, RewardPlatform, PlaceholderCharmPickup, EndGate blocks, and a level-wide FallZone under LevelPrototype.
- Kept PlayerController, CameraFollow, GameManager, and Retry UI support working in the new scene.
- Imported Night_shrine_1_background.png into Assets/Art/Backgrounds and added it as the NightApproach background.
- Extended NightApproach into a longer horizontal side-scrolling route with a longer final approach road and farther EndGate.
- Added the first basic combat tutorial: PlayerAttack, short-lived attack hitboxes on J, GhostEnemy floating behavior, a GhostEnemy prefab, and three Ghost enemies in NightApproach.
- Added first miko visual states for the Player: stand, run, jump, and attack pose switching.
- Created a transparent easy_ghost sprite variant and assigned it to Ghost enemies and the GhostEnemy prefab.
- Adjusted the NightApproach background placement and softened prototype platform colors so the stage reads more like one shrine road scene.
- Fixed the miko facing direction so movement and attack visuals match the player's input direction.
- Nudged the NightApproach background upward to better line up the painted stone road with the prototype platforms.
- Generated transparent miko sprite variants and updated the Player to use them, removing the baked white/checkerboard background.
- Generated a first MikoPurifySlash attack effect sprite and assigned it to the PlayerAttack hitbox visual.
- Fixed the MikoPurifySlash facing logic so the effect points in the player's attack direction.
- Added NightApproach to EditorBuildSettings.
- Updated TaskList.md with the new tutorial level progress.
